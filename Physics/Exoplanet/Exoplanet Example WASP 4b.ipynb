    "In this exercise, you will be analysing data from the transit of the exoplanet WASP 4b around its host star, WASP 4. Just like our own Sun, lots of stars have one or more planets orbitting around them. These are called exoplanets. \n",
    "\n",
    "They were first detected by an experiment which watched the brightness of a star over a long period of time. What the astronomers noticed was that, periodically, the brightness of the star would decrease for a time before eventually returning to its usual level of brightness. This was interpretted as a planet passing in front of the the star and blocking some of its light, causing the star to appear dimmer to us. This method of exoplanet detection is called the transit method.\n",

    "Since the transit method was developed, it has been used to identify over 4,000 exoplanets in our galaxy. By observing the transit of an exoplanet in front of its host star, numerous features of the system can be calculated, including the radius of the planet. "
